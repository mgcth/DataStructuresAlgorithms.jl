# Data structures and algorithms - DAT038/TIN093

Implementation of some data structures and algorithms from the Chalmers courses DAT038 and TIN093 in Julia as en exercise and for fun. Many of the implementations are straight from instructions and invariants. Meaning code could be more efficient, general and clean. Some interfaces are also missing, but patched on a need-to-use basis.

Work ongoing, currently at hash maps which are not fully working. Red-black and AVL trees, and graphs (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*) left, and then some more algorithms.
