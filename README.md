# Data structures and algorithms - DAT038

Implementation of some data structures and algorithms from the Chalmers course DAT038 in Julia as en exercise and for fun. Implemented from instructions and invariants mostly, code might not be the most efficient or clean. Not all algorithms are present. Some interfaces are implemented for some data structures.

Work ongoing, currently at heaps which are not fully working. Tree algorithms and graphs left.
